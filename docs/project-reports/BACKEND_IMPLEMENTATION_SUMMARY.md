# Backend Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented comprehensive backend support for Project and Invoice management in the DevHub API to match the existing frontend components.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Models

#### Project Model (`/src/devhub_api/models/project.py`)

- **Fields**: name, description, status, priority, budget, start_date, end_date, estimated_hours, actual_hours
- **Relationships**: tenant, customer, creator, assignee, invoices
- **Status Enum**: PLANNED, IN_PROGRESS, ON_HOLD, COMPLETED, CANCELLED  
- **Priority Enum**: LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, URGENT
- **Features**: Multi-tenant support, audit trails, performance indexes

#### Invoice & InvoiceItem Models (`/src/devhub_api/models/invoice.py`)

- **Invoice Fields**: invoice_number, status, issue_date, due_date, subtotal, tax_rate, tax_amount, total_amount, notes, terms
- **InvoiceItem Fields**: description, quantity, unit_price, total
- **Relationships**: customer, project (optional), tenant, items
- **Status Enum**: DRAFT, PENDING, SENT, VIEWED, PAID, OVERDUE, CANCELLED
- **Features**: Line items support, tax calculations, overdue tracking

### 2. Pydantic Schemas

#### Project Schemas (`/src/devhub_api/schemas/project.py`)

- `ProjectCreate` - For creating new projects
- `ProjectUpdate` - For updating existing projects
- `ProjectResponse` - For API responses with related data
- `ProjectList` - For paginated lists
- `ProjectFilters` - For search and filtering

#### Invoice Schemas (`/src/devhub_api/schemas/invoice.py`)

- `InvoiceCreate` - For creating invoices with line items
- `InvoiceUpdate` - For updating invoices
- `InvoiceResponse` - For API responses with customer/project data
- `InvoiceList` - For paginated lists
- `InvoiceFilters` - For search and filtering
- `InvoiceSummary` - For dashboard statistics

### 3. API Endpoints

#### Projects API (`/src/devhub_api/api/v1/projects.py`)

- `POST /api/v1/projects/` - Create project
- `GET /api/v1/projects/` - List projects (paginated, filtered)
- `GET /api/v1/projects/{id}` - Get project details
- `PATCH /api/v1/projects/{id}` - Update project
- `DELETE /api/v1/projects/{id}` - Delete project

#### Invoices API (`/src/devhub_api/api/v1/invoices.py`)

- `POST /api/v1/invoices/` - Create invoice with line items
- `GET /api/v1/invoices/` - List invoices (paginated, filtered)
- `GET /api/v1/invoices/summary` - Get invoice statistics
- `GET /api/v1/invoices/{id}` - Get invoice details
- `PATCH /api/v1/invoices/{id}` - Update invoice
- `DELETE /api/v1/invoices/{id}` - Delete invoice

### 4. Model Relationships Updated

#### Customer Model

- Added `projects` relationship to Customer
- Added `invoices` relationship to Customer

#### Tenant Model

- Already had `projects` and `invoices` relationships

#### User Model

- Already had project-related relationships

## Features Implemented

### Multi-Tenant Architecture

- All models include `tenant_id` for data isolation
- API endpoints filter by tenant automatically
- Proper foreign key relationships maintained

### Data Validation

- Comprehensive Pydantic schemas with validation rules
- Enum constraints for status and priority fields
- Date validation and business rules

### Performance Optimizations

- Database indexes on commonly queried fields
- Eager loading with `joinedload` for related data
- Pagination support for large datasets

### API Features

- RESTful endpoint design
- Comprehensive filtering and searching
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Detailed error handling
- Multi-tenant security

### Business Logic

- Invoice calculation support (subtotal, tax, total)
- Project status tracking with lifecycle management
- Overdue detection for invoices
- Relationship integrity (customer validation)

## Integration Points

### Frontend Compatibility

- API responses match frontend component expectations
- Same field names and data structures as frontend forms
- Status enums align with frontend select options

### Existing System Integration

- Leverages existing auth system (placeholder for JWT)
- Uses existing database connection and session management
- Follows established model patterns (BaseModel, TimestampMixin)
- Integrates with existing CRM customer data

## Security Considerations

### Authentication & Authorization

- Placeholder auth context (to be replaced with JWT)
- Tenant-based data isolation
- User permission hooks ready for implementation

### Data Integrity

- Foreign key constraints
- Cascade delete for invoice items
- Validation at both schema and database levels

## Next Steps

### Database Migration

1. Create migration files for new tables:

   ```bash
   alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Add projects and invoices tables"
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

### Testing

1. Run the backend test: `python test_backend.py`
2. Start development server: `uvicorn src.devhub_api.main:app --reload`
3. Test API endpoints with tools like Postman or curl

### Authentication Integration

1. Replace placeholder auth with proper JWT token validation
2. Implement role-based permissions
3. Add user context to API operations

### Frontend Integration

1. Update frontend service layer to call new API endpoints
2. Test end-to-end functionality
3. Handle error states and loading indicators

## API Documentation

When the server is running, comprehensive API documentation is available at:

- Swagger UI: `http://localhost:8000/docs`
- ReDoc: `http://localhost:8000/redoc`

The documentation includes all endpoint details, request/response schemas, and interactive testing capabilities.
